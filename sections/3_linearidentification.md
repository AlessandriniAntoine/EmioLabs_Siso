## Linear Model Identification

**Linear Model Identification.**
From the previous step, we have reduced the dimensionality of the state vector, making it suitable for control and model identification. We now aim to identify a discrete-time linear state-space model of the system.

A linear state-space model is defined by the state matrix $A$, the input matrix $B$, and the output matrix $C$, following the equations::

$$\begin{array}{rcl} x(k+1) &=& Ax(k) + Bu(k) \\ y(k) &=& Cx(k) \end{array}.$$

For simplicity, we will use $x$ to denote $x(k)$ and $x^{+}$ for $x(k+1)$.

By stacking all collected measurements into matrices, the system dynamics can be compactly written as:

$$ \begin{bmatrix} x_1^+ & \ldots & x_L^+ \end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix} A & B \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 & \ldots & x_L \\ u_1 & \ldots & u_L \end{bmatrix}$$

The matrices $A$ and $B$ can therefore be identified by solving a least-squares problem, using the Mooreâ€“Penrose pseudo-inverse. Specifically:

$$\begin{bmatrix} A & B \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x_{1}^{+} & \ldots & x_{L}^{+}\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_{1} & \ldots & x_{L} \\ u_{1} & \ldots & u_{L} \end{bmatrix}^{\dagger} $$

where $*^\dagger$ is the pseudo inverse of matrix.

Similarly, the output matrix $C$ can be identified. Since the output corresponds to marker positions, which depend only on the position components $p$ of the state vector (and not the velocities), we restrict the output identification to the position subspace.

Let $C_p$ be the matrix mapping from the reduced positions to the measured outputs. It can be obtained by solving the following least-squares problem:

$$C_p = \begin{bmatrix} y_{1} & \ldots & y_{L}\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} p_{1} & \ldots & p_{L}\end{bmatrix}^{\dagger}$$

where $y_i$ is the measured output (e.g., marker position) and $p_i$ is the corresponding position extracted from the full state vector.

Since the full reduced state vector is composed of both velocities and positions (i.e., $x^\top=\begin{pmatrix} v^\top & p^\top\end{pmatrix}$), the final output matrix $C$, which maps the full reduced state to the output, is given by:

$$C = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & C_p \end{bmatrix}$$

This structure reflects the fact that the output depends solely on the position part of the state.
